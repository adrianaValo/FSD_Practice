useEffect Hook:

- We can use it to render the data after it was changed

- when you want to do something in the background, using the timer


The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

==========================================================================

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);
